### Automated Swing Trading Bot

 I created this Automated Swing Trading Bot because I wanted to apply my data skills in a real-world financial setting while exploring how data analytics intersects with finance. My major emphasizes economics, and I’ve been diving into the financial side of data analysis, so this project was a natural step in that journey.

- Developed a Python-based trading bot that automates swing trading using Alpaca API, retrieving real-time stock data and executing trades based on technical indicators.
- Implemented Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD to generate buy/sell signals.
- Automated data collection with Alpaca’s StockHistoricalDataClient, analyzing stock trends over a 100-day period.
- Designed trade execution logic to place market orders based on SMA crossovers and RSI thresholds, reducing manual intervention.
- Monitored real-time stock movements for assets like AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, and AMZN, integrating results into a data-driven decision-making framework.
